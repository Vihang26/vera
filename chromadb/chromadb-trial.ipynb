You can trigger Lambda from over 200 AWS services and software as a service (SaaS) applications, and only pay for what you use.File processing\\xa0Stream processing\\xa0Web applications\\xa0IoT backends\\xa0Mobile backends.  \\nFrançais\\n Benefits of AWS\\nJan Červinka Director of Engineering, Purple Technology \\nEspañol\\n Amazon EC2\\nThe Czech-based company builds apps that complement online trading platforms and support the changing and demanding needs of brokers. Purple’s solution enables tens of thousands of clients to trade many billions of dollars of assets each month.\\n日本語\\nIn addition, brokers and traders must comply with rules that change from country to country. These rules are subject to sudden changes in regulation—and even to evolving legal interpretations.\\n Get Started\\n한국어\\nAmazon DynamoDB is a fully managed, serverless, key-value NoSQL database designed to run high-performance applications at any scale. DynamoDB offers built-in security, continuous backups, automated multi-Region replication, in-memory caching, and data import and export tools. \\nIncreases transparency of complex processes\\n Purple Technology Responds Rapidly to Changing Regulations and Customer Needs Using AWS\\n \\n Amazon Lambda\\nPurple needed a more transparent and effective way to manage the complex ruleset that governed customer onboarding and allow it to respond more quickly to changing rules. It found the solution it needed using AWS Step Functions, a low-code, visual workflow service that developers can use to build applications. “Onboarding involves complex processes that we have to be able to understand and update easily,” says Jan Červinka, director of engineering at Purple Technology. “We can now map and design all of these processes using AWS Step Functions.”\\nTo register new trading accounts with brokers, users need to go through a number of steps to qualify. The registration process checks many conditions, some via API, to confirm that the new customer is not disqualified from trading. Purple’s onboarding process also supports Know Your Customer (KYC) user verification and anti-money laundering (AML) processes.\\n Amazon Step functions\\n AWS Services Used\\nPurple wanted greater transparency and control to improve its services and reduce the in-house resources required to maintain its applications. Using Amazon Web Services (AWS), Purple found a way to easily manage changes to the backend ruleset and make the ruleset more transparent to internal and external stakeholders.\\n中文 (繁體)\\nBahasa Indonesia\\nWhile the Purple application has a user-friendly front end, the backend was a complex code base. Changes to the rules required developers to delve into the code to make amendments and make sure the app was compliant. Questions from product managers about the rules and processes required developers to create diagrams that would quickly become outdated.\\n  Contact Sales \\nΡусский\\nعربي\\n中文 (简体)\\nTo simplify this maintenance process further, Purple built a Slack extension to allow rules to be repaired and amended from the messaging platform. This also means customer service teams at brokers can operate the tool and provide a responsive service to their own customers. Using AWS we have significantly improved the self-service capabilities of the customer support teams,” says Červinka. “That leads to a much faster time to resolution of certain issues customers may encounter.”\\n About Purple Technology \\nLearn more\\xa0»\\nBuild and run applications without thinking about servers.\\xa0Severless on AWS \\nResponding to Changing Regulatory Changes\\nOn AWS, Purple also has greater freedom to innovate. Using AWS infrastructure as code means that developers can spin up test environments to work on new features. These test environments consume fewer resources than production sites. “Using AWS we can experiment and play with new ideas. And we have the confidence that we can stay on top of the changes to regulations through better control and transparency with AWS services,” says Pýrek. \\nUsing AWS Step Functions, the company always has up-to-date product documentation as it is automatically generated. Now if a regulator or legal counsel asks to review the application’s processes, Purple can share the documentation to demonstrate how it complies. “It’s much easier to produce visual reports and diagrams for our compliance stakeholders,” says Červinka. “That frees up IT teams from having to provide complex, time-intensive—and not really fun—support so they can instead focus on building new features.”\\nReduces maintenance burden on developer team\\nTürkçe\\nFinTech company Purple Technology builds applications and services for brokerage firms to onboard customers efficiently. End users self-manage their accounts and portfolios, which leaves brokerages free to focus on core functions such as client services and risk management. Users creating new trading accounts with brokers need to follow a stringent onboarding process that complies with complex rules and regulations to verify their identities. Using AWS, Purple has simplified the way these rulesets are coded into the app, making it easier for non-technical employees to manage the application and keep on top of changing regulations. \\nEnglish\\nBut managing those rules was a complex and time-consuming process, often requiring developer resources that would be better spent on product innovation, not maintenance.\\nResolves software issues more efficiently\\nAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.\\nDevelopers can also devote more time to improving the platform rather than troubleshooting issues, because AWS Step Functions has reduced the time required for debugging. This has increased the team’s speed of development.\\nDeutsch\\n Amazon DynamoDB\\nTrading and investing online relies on transparency, and trust in the platform, in the brokers, and in the identity of traders. Purple Technology helps build that trust.\\nTiếng Việt\\nItaliano\\nไทย\\nUsing AWS, we have greater visibility into our complex processes, making them simple to visualize, manage, and update. This means we can be more responsive to any new or changing regulations and to customer needs.” \\nBoosts speed of development of new features \\nCommunication with business decision-makers on new software features is now more productive. “It’s easy to read and modify AWS Step Functions,” says Filip Pýrek, serverless architect at Purple Technology. “We use it for prototyping when designing features, so non-technical colleagues can understand and discuss new processes.”\\n2022\\nBased in the Czech Republic, Purple Technology is a financial technology company founded in 2011. It provides an online trading platform for brokerages and their clients around the world. \\n Faster Development and Product Maintenance\\nAs a FinTech company, Purple’s solution has to comply with a huge number of legal and regulatory rules that vary from territory to territory and are subject to constant change. Purple’s solution needs to accurately capture these rules to run checks during new trader account registrations.\\nAWS Step Functions is a low-code, visual workflow service that developers use to build distributed applications, automate IT and business processes, and build data and machine learning pipelines using AWS services. Workflows manage failures, retries, parallelization, service integrations, and observability so developers can focus on higher-value business logic.  \\nPortuguês\\nUsing AWS Step Functions, Purple Technology maps out the workflows for each process so that it can easily fix any issues and demonstrate to regulators how customer checks are carried out. In addition, rather than drawing on developers to make changes, Purple can use trained, non-technical people to carry out maintenance.\\n10\\n AWS Lambda\\nConfiguring Cloud Environments 3x Faster\\nFrançais\\nSpacelift supports customers working in pure cloud environments as well as those running hybrid models because they need to store certain data on premises to comply with security or privacy regulations.\\nCut down on security and compliance issues by a factor of 10 \\nEspañol\\nThis means customers require fewer senior-level IT staff or can increase productivity of current developers, so they have more time to create innovative products and features. “When new developers join a company, they can spin up all the infrastructure they need in seconds with little product knowledge, and then quickly minimize error risks and correct any misconfigurations,” says Wyszynski. “Through automation, our customers’ DevOps teams can configure cloud environments 3 times faster than doing the same work manually.”\\n 90%\\nTo ensure that its platform is flexible and able to scale rapidly, Spacelift uses AWS Lambda, which allows users to run code without thinking about servers or clusters. This helps the company deal with unpredictable workload demand from customers. “A single customer might launch a thousand tasks that need addressing, and then have nothing to process for the next hour,” says Kuba Martin, software engineer at Spacelift. “Using AWS Lambda, we can quickly spin up compute capacity to deal with incoming requests, so they can be resolved quickly and tasks don’t accumulate. This means our customers experience reliable performance—and they stay happy.”  \\nEasing Communication for Hybrid Environments Using AWS IoT Core \\nDevelopers working for Spacelift’s customers can set up cloud environments immediately, even if they have minimal cloud experience, because Spacelift provides an easy-to-use interface to the underlying AWS setup.\\n日本語\\n  Contact Sales \\n 2022\\nSpacelift Reduces Time Spent on Cloud Management by 90% Using AWS\\n한국어\\nSped up cloud environments’ configurations by 300% \\nOverview | Opportunity | Solution | Outcome | AWS Services Used \\nThis reduces the complexity of the infrastructure so it can be managed with fewer DevOps engineers. It also means that new environments needed for startups or a large company opening a new office, for instance, can be set up quickly, easing corporate expansions. Automation also reduces the error rates compared to manual configurations, so its customers’ platforms are more reliable for their end customers.\\n \\nBased in Silicon Valley and Poland, Spacelift has created a platform that simplifies the management of complex cloud environments. That means IT teams can focus on creating innovative products, rather than maintaining infrastructure. The approach has proved popular and spurred the company’s growth from 1 to 40 employees over 2 years.\\nTo ensure high levels of reliability, security, and compliance for its platform, Spacelift turned to Amazon Web Services (AWS). Using AWS, the start-up has helped customers such as Checkout.com and Kin cut down on the time spent on repetitive infrastructure maintenance tasks by 90 percent.

The company plans to become as cloud native as possible and is potentially looking to shift its extract, transform, and load jobs to AWS Lambda. Capital One recently adopted AWS Glue, a serverless data integration service used to discover, prepare, move, and integrate data from multiple sources, and at the same time, evaluated other new serverless options, such as AWS Step Functions, visual workflows for distributed applications, alongside AWS Lambda. “Any organization that’s committed to its technical transformation should work alongside the AWS team to go in the right direction,” says Mao. \\n           2023 \\nAnother benefit of going serverless is the improved cost efficiency. By migrating to AWS Lambda, Capital One hopes to improve its costs. It can achieve this in part by saving developer time. “If we can save developers’ time by reducing infrastructure-related work, that savings is enormous,” says Mao. The other cost-efficiency factor is AWS Lambda’s pay-as-you-use model. The company pays at a per-millisecond interval for compute costs. “The cost efficiency is awesome. It changes the way that we think about building applications,” says Mao. “Using AWS Lambda, our engineers learn to build small and think about performance.” One application achieved 90 percent cost savings by migrating to AWS Lambda.\\nEspañol\\nLearn more »\\ncost savings for applications \\n日本語\\n AWS Services Used\\n Capital One Saves Developer Time and Reduces Costs by Going Serverless on AWS\\n Get Started\\n한국어\\nOverview | Opportunity | Solution | Outcome | AWS Services Used \\n AWS SAM\\n \\n Improved\\n         \\nSolution | Improving Speed to Market and Reducing Costs Using AWS Serverless Technologies \\nGeorge Mao\\x0b Senior Distinguished Engineer, Capital One Financial Corporation \\n Amazon ECS\\n Overview\\n中文 (繁體)\\nBahasa Indonesia\\nOpportunity | Using AWS Lambda to Save Developer Time for Capital One \\nMany Capital One applications run once a day, and others run once a month, which makes leaving instances up all the time inefficient. “When we migrate to AWS Lambda, our teams don’t have to worry about whether to scale instances up or down,” says Mao. “The same batch process that runs 1 or 100 times a day runs on AWS Lambda.” Developers can spend their time and effort making better products for the customers rather than worrying about managing or operating the infrastructure. The company is making better applications and delivering more features faster with a quicker time to market. “All the things that make the cloud great are enhanced by going serverless, which is a win-win for us and our customers,” says Mao.\\nCapital One Financial Corporation (Capital One) exited its last legacy, on-premises data centers in 2020 to go all in on the cloud. Capital One has strict timelines for code patches, machine refreshes, and bug remediation. Its engineers, who would prefer to be building applications, were spending significant time working on infrastructure. Capital One improved its cost efficiency, speed to market, and developer quality of life by using Amazon Web Services (AWS) such as AWS Lambda—a serverless, event-driven compute service that businesses use to run code for virtually any type of application or backend service without provisioning or managing servers. The company is now achieving significant time savings for its developers in applications that are migrated to serverless compute while remaining well governed. \\nΡусский\\nAny organization that’s committed to its technical transformation should work alongside the AWS team to go in the right direction. \\nعربي\\n中文 (简体)\\nOrganizations of all sizes across all industries are transforming their businesses and delivering on their missions every day using AWS.

During this digital transformation, the company has benefited from directly communicating with AWS service specialists for near-real-time support when it has production outages and service issues. “We treat the AWS account team as an extension of our internal architecture teams and communicate with the team daily to handle service issues and get updates quickly,” says Mao.\\nLearn how Capital One in financial services saved developer time and reduced cost by going serverless using AWS Lambda and Amazon ECS. \\nLearn more\\xa0»\\noperational efficency \\n\\xa0\\n Up to 90%\\nWith its applications running in various states of monolithic and modern architectures, Capital One’s default strategy is to migrate its applications to serverless compute, where it can reduce the overall operational burden for its engineering teams and increase operational efficiency. This migration helped the company ease the challenges that are associated with legacy architectures by reducing idle times and improving local debugging. For use cases when AWS Lambda cannot be used, the company uses Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)—which runs highly secure, reliable, and scalable containers—powered by AWS Fargate, a serverless, pay-as-you-go compute engine that is used to build applications without managing servers.\\n AWS Fargate\\nCustomer Stories / Financial Services \\nThe company’s engineers use a central pipeline that has been upgraded to adapt to serverless computing to release code. To reduce the idle time that its engineers have to spend waiting for releases to go through this pipeline, Capital One uses the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM), an open-source framework for building serverless applications that provides shorthand syntax to express functions, APIs, databases, and event source mappings. By using AWS SAM, its engineers can run as much as possible locally before touching the release pipeline. Capital One has adapted its tooling and release process to deploy tens of thousands of AWS Lambda functions. “We can get what we need out of standard tooling like AWS SAM,” says Mao.\\nnew applications in days \\nTürkçe\\nEnglish\\nAWS Fargate is a serverless, pay-as-you-go compute engine that lets you focus on building applications without managing servers. \\nAmazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service that makes it easy for you to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications.\\nThe AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) is an open-source framework for building serverless applications.. \\n Saved\\n About Capital One Financial Corporation\\n Built\\nDeutsch\\nAWS Lambda is a serverless, event-driven compute service that lets you run code for virtually any type of application or backend service without provisioning or managing servers.  \\nBy migrating its applications to serverless services like AWS Lambda, Capital One has achieved significant time savings across different developer teams.

To address this, the company attempted to build a new analytics solution with MySQL as the data source. However, database queries often took up to 15 seconds to complete, and the solution couldn’t meet the company’s goal of providing response times under 10 seconds. The result? A poor customer experience, and one that could not scale easily to support the millions of new records coming in every year.\\xa0\\n Overview\\nThe solution is based on Amazon Redshift, a cloud data warehouse that uses SQL to analyze both structured and semi-structured data. The AWS team helped LambdaTest create a proof of concept (POC) for a new customer-facing dashboard that queries data from Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) and ingests it in Amazon Redshift.

The infrastructure was based on a combination of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) to handle the transfer of information to and from devices via the MQTT protocol.\\n Overview\\nWe estimate that by moving to AWS IoT Core along with AWS Lambda, we can shift 30 percent more IT resources to product development.”\\nDexatek increased the performance of its Internet of Things (IoT) platform, enhanced security, and lowered management time by migrating to AWS IoT Core.\\nOpportunity | Making Smart Devices Easier to Scale and Less Management Intensive\\n Dexatek Optimizes Its IoT Platform and Boosts Spend on Innovation by 30% with AWS\\n Amazon EC2\\nTürkçe\\n  Resume slide rotation  \\nEnglish\\nOutcome | Creating Opportunities for New Markets with AWS\\nLowered coding and testing times from months\\nThe company is currently experimenting with Amazon SageMaker to help train machine learning models and AWS IoT Greengrass to leverage pre-built software components that would speed up delivery of the IoT device software. “If your goals are to reduce costs and make IoT devices smarter, then AWS has what you need,” Chen concludes.\\n About Dexatek Technology\\n 30% \\nDexatek can also onboard businesses quicker, launching IoT platform demos for new customers in less than a week—a process that could previously take three months. This is because AWS IoT Core makes coding easier and testing periods shorter. Chen explains, “We give the engineers a heads up on what we need them to do, and after three to five days, they’re saying, ‘It’s done.’”\\nSolution | Freeing Up Resources for Innovation with AWS IoT Core \\xa0\\n < 5 days\\nDexatek Technology, based in Taiwan, gives electronic consumer products smart capabilities using its IoT solutions.

Chen expects it to significantly reduce the amount of infrastructure management that IT personnel will need to perform. “We estimate that by moving to AWS IoT Core along with AWS Lambda, we can shift 30 percent more IT resources to product development,” he says.\\nDexatek Technology helps consumer electronics companies incorporate smart technology into products like light switches, thermostats, and air-conditioning units. It equips businesses with Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities so that customers can remotely monitor and control their devices, such as adjusting the temperatures of their homes or scheduling when their lights come on. The company is taking advantage of the growing market for smart home products, which is expected to attract $173 billion in consumer spending worldwide by 2025.\\nWith optimization as its goal, Dexatek looked at moving from Amazon EC2 to AWS Lambda serverless service. In addition, it began investigating AWS IoT Core to join, manage, and scale its smart device connections without having to think about security. Says Chen, “We decided to engage with AWS Solutions Architects to make sure we proceeded correctly. We wanted them to double-check everything we did to avoid any delays in the optimization process.”\\nPortuguês\\nAWS Lambda\\nFrançais\\nAchieved HIPAA compliance quickly\\nFounded in 2016, LifeOmic has over 100 employees and a variety of healthcare software solutions. The company started by creating Precision Health Cloud, a secure cloud solution that integrates and indexes disparate data sources, including genomic, clinical, imaging, and population data. This system currently stores 400 million clinical data points and 500 billion genetic variants, including 55 billion unique genetic variants. In addition to supporting healthcare organizations, LifeOmic wanted to offer solutions to help consumers live healthier lives. After it had achieved a solution that was compliant with HIPAA and the HITRUST Alliance, LifeOmic developed mobile apps designed to empower individuals to manage their own health. “We can support all of these products on the same solution and reuse a lot of code, so we’re able to achieve a lot and expand into new marketplaces with a relatively small team,” says Anthony Roach, technical director at LifeOmic.\\nEspañol\\nScales to meet peak demand\\n日本語\\n AWS Services Used\\n  Contact Sales \\n AWS Step Functions\\n한국어\\nMakes an average of 100 production deployment updates per day\\nChris Hemp Vice President of Engineering, LifeOmic\\xa0\\nSupports a growing base of over four million users\\n \\nWith its secure, scalable serverless architecture on AWS, LifeOmic is equipped to support the full continuum of healthcare, from research and preventive medicine to diagnosis and treatment management. “We wouldn’t have had nearly as much breadth if we hadn’t used AWS,” says Roach. Four million users and counting have downloaded LifeOmic’s mobile applications, which connect with wearable devices and pacemakers. The company can scale to meet demand—such as when New Year’s resolutions led to a three-times increase in application sessions in January compared to December—using simple controls without needing to add new hardware.\\nAmazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. APIs act as the \"front door\" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services. \\n Achieving Scalable, HIPAA-Compliant Data Storage on AWS\\n Get Started\\n About LifeOmic\\nBy using fully managed serverless solutions on AWS, LifeOmic was able to reduce or remove its ongoing maintenance and operations costs, launch quickly, and prepare to scale with agility as the company adds new products and features. “The ease and speed of serverless development on AWS has helped our small team deliver a large set of features in just a few months,” says Chris Hemp, vice president of engineering at LifeOmic. \\n LifeOmic Achieves up to 50% Cost Savings after Building Serverless Architecture on AWS\\nLifeOmic has built a secure health solution that powers analytics, interventions, and engagement solutions for improving health outcomes across the continuum of care, from prevention and wellness to clinical care and research. \\n中文 (繁體)\\nBahasa Indonesia\\nBecoming multitenant to support everything from small clinical practices to large hospital systems was also an important goal for LifeOmic. To achieve this, the company needed scalable data stores, and it saw that AWS provided a variety of potential solutions. By using managed services like Lambda, LifeOmic could keep operational costs low and empower its team to focus on developing software, not running the backend. “Some companies try to do cloud-agnostic development, but they lose the benefits that a designated cloud vendor can provide,” says Roach. “On AWS, we gain everything we need, from serverless code to data stores, so we don’t have to worry about multiple vendors and compatibilities.” \\nIn April 2020, LifeOmic sought to become compliant with the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program, and it achieved this goal by April 2021. “We wouldn’t have achieved these federal standards in 1 year if we weren’t using AWS,” says Hemp. “Using AWS, we were able to keep up with the requirements for documentation and security and have the support that we needed.” \\nAvoids infrastructure costs and capital expenses\\nΡусский\\nAchieved Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program compliance in 1 year\\nعربي\\nInitially, LifeOmic focused on building genomic pipelines using AWS services such as Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), a fully managed container orchestration service. Early on, the company started building APIs and began using AWS Lambda to speed up API development processes as soon as the service became HIPAA eligible. By using AWS Lambda with a Hypertext Transfer Protocol interface layered on, LifeOmic’s developers were able to write and deliver code with ease, even if they were unfamiliar with AWS Lambda.\\n中文 (简体)\\nSoftware company LifeOmic knew that to improve health outcomes, researchers, clinicians, and device manufacturers in healthcare and biotech organizations needed a secure solution for interaction and data management. To build this solution quickly and cost efficiently, LifeOmic chose a serverless architecture on Amazon Web Services (AWS).\\xa0\\n Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)\\nLearn more\\xa0»\\n\\xa0\\n Benefits of AWS\\nAmazon ECS is a fully managed container orchestration service that helps you easily deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications. It deeply integrates with the rest of the AWS platform to provide a secure and easy-to-use solution for running container workloads in the cloud and now on your infrastructure with Amazon ECS Anywhere. \\nGrowing the company from the ground up on AWS has helped LifeOmic focus on innovation instead of infrastructure management. Next, the company is looking into using Amazon Timestream, a serverless time series database service, to add new features that call for continuous data, such as intraday heart rate and continuous glucose monitoring. LifeOmic also continues to expand its customer base and is seeing growing trust in the cloud. “Our customers are confident in the reliability of AWS,” says Roach. “That and our ability to put out new features so quickly have created a winning combination.” \\nTürkçe\\nThe company has also realized business benefits, including faster time to market from using automation to make an average of 100 production deployment updates in 1 day. LifeOmic has also achieved cost savings of 30–50 percent by adopting Lambda, including using provisioned concurrency and Compute Savings Plans, a flexible pricing model that offers low prices on AWS Lambda usage. The company has also seen success recruiting and retaining employees, who are excited to use AWS services. Many participate in AWS Training and have either renewed their AWS Certifications or have achieved one for the first time.\\nEnglish\\nReduced costs by 30%–50%\\n Scaling Healthcare Applications Using AWS Lambda\\n Amazon API Gateway\\nImproved employee recruitment and retention \\nDeutsch\\nWhen Amazon OpenSearch Service—which makes it easy to perform interactive log analytics, near-real-time application monitoring, and website searches—became HIPAA eligible, LifeOmic was able to add analytics and search features to its Precision Health Cloud. LifeOmic now uses OpenSearch Service as its biggest data store, housing 500 billion documents. Another milestone for LifeOmic was joining AWS Activate, a program that offers startups free tools, resources, and more to quickly get started on AWS. The program offered insights into the AWS road map, helping LifeOmic make its own decisions about its next steps.\\nAWS Step Functions is a low-code, visual workflow service that developers use to build distributed applications, automate IT and business processes, and build data and machine learning pipelines using AWS services. \\nTiếng Việt\\nThe ease and speed of serverless development using AWS has helped our small team deliver a large set of features in just a few months.”\\xa0 \\n Continuing to Grow and Innovate\\nItaliano\\nไทย\\nIn LifeOmic’s pipeline, applications make code initiation requests through Amazon API Gateway, a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. The pipeline then uses AWS Lambda to run code to retrieve data from Amazon DynamoDB, a fast, flexible NoSQL database service. And to achieve smooth workflows, LifeOmic uses AWS Step Functions, a low-code, visual workflow service that developers can use to build distributed applications and automate IT and business processes. “Using AWS Step Functions, we can achieve long-running processes easily because everything is managed for us,” says Roach.\\n2022\\nAWS Lambda is a serverless, event-driven compute service that lets you run code for virtually any type of application or backend service without provisioning or managing servers. You can trigger Lambda from over 200 AWS services and software as a service (SaaS) applications, and only pay for what you use.\\nLifeOmic decided to build its solution from the ground up on AWS because AWS services like AWS Lambda—a serverless, event-driven compute service—make it simpler to process, store, and transmit protected health information, facilitating HIPAA compliance. “It can take years for startups to meet HIPAA compliance requirements,” says Roach. “LifeOmic started under the assumption of meeting these requirements and more. We tackled and achieved the rigorous HITRUST CSF Certification in less than 6 months with zero corrective actions, and using AWS made it much easier.”\\nPortuguês\\nOrganizations of all sizes across all industries are transforming their businesses and delivering on their missions every day using AWS.
